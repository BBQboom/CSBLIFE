<font face="TimesNewRoman" size="8">New Roles, New Routines, New Relationships, New Assumptions</font><BR><BR> 
<font face="Calibri" size="5">College, a fresh new start for me. A new chapter in life. College was said to be the phase in life which could mold you into what you'll become in the near future, and when this phase is at hand I started having new roles in life. If I am to be a professional Game Designer/Developer I have to press on no matter what the world throws at me. </font><BR><BR> 

<font face="TimesNewRoman" size="8">New Routines</font><BR><BR> 
<font face="Calibri" size="5">College life presented new routines for me. I have to learn the ways of the people. I sleep less now and work more. I was a serious gamer before but now I'm a serious programmer who'se willing to grind for 10,000 hours to achieve expert level. It may be hard but I will strive for success!</font>,<BR><BR> 

<font face="TimesNewRoman" size="8">New Relationships</font><BR><BR>
<font face="Calibri" size="5">I've met lot's of new people. Students, professors, and a new set of friends. I'm eager to know more of them and eager to meet more as they will be important connections in the near future. </font><BR><BR> 

<font face="TimesNewRoman" size="8">New Assumptions</font><BR><BR> 
<font face="Calibri" size="5">Assumptions. Hmm... I expect to become an IT expert in a year or two. I also assume to work in a good company for OJT(definitely abroad).Make more friends and money. So I pray to God that I would study and live life to the fullest as I dont want to waste a single penny from my parent's wallet. I would want to make them proud.</font>
